# 💫 About Me  
I'm an **undergraduate in Information Science & Engineering** with a primary interest in **Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, complemented by solid experience in **full-stack and backend development**. I focus on building **practical, production-ready AI systems**—where models are not just trained, but **integrated into real applications**, optimized for performance, and deployed securely.

My work largely revolves around **applied ML, NLP, computer vision, and LLM-powered tools**, while also being comfortable across the broader software engineering stack. I enjoy translating complex data and models into **scalable, user-friendly solutions**, and collaborating across domains to deliver real-world impact.

Driven by curiosity and hands-on engineering, I aim to contribute to **AI-first products** while maintaining strong fundamentals in **system design, APIs, databases, and frontend development**.
