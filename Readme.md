# 💫 About Me  
I'm a final-year **Information Science & Engineering** student with a strong focus on **Applied Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data-Driven Systems**. I specialize in building **production-ready AI applications** that bridge the gap between **theory and real-world deployment**—from intelligent NLP systems to computer vision pipelines and scalable backend services.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI + Software Engineering**, where models are not just trained, but **secured, optimized, deployed, and scaled**. My interests lie in **applied ML, NLP systems, LLM-powered tools, and AI-backed web applications** that deliver measurable impact.

Driven by curiosity and engineering discipline, I aim to design **robust, scalable, and user-centric AI solutions** that solve real business and societal problems.
